# Hog's Space Exploration

Ever wanted to explore space in minecraft? Well I have, and I've made this a reality.
```Experimental toggles required : Upcoming creator features, Custom Biomes (just to be safe), Creator Cameras: New Third person presets```

This addon adds 3 new planets to explore as well as being the first minecrafter on the moon!

How to explore space :
First you should craft a rocket (all recipes found in the recipe book)

Before you lift off, how about crafting a space suit. There is no oxygen in space. (crafted with new aluminium ingots)

Now you're ready to lift off, sit in the rocket and hold the jump button to launch into space.
You will find yourself inside the space station, this will be your hub between planets without having to return to earth all the time

Pressing the keypad found in the space station, you can blast off again and explore the solar system

Fly into the planets to explore them. Each planet has custom blocks and generation. Happy exploring!
(no spoilers of the planets)
